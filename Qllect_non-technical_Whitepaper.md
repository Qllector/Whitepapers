# Qllect non-technical Whitepaper

## Abstract
-
Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are not just monetary instruments. 
Using them as cryptographic tokens for other assets is probably the most fascinating aspect. 
Examples for technical platforms going into this direction would be Colored Coins, Mastercoin, the freshly started Ethereum, Bitshares, Nxt, and others. 

We want to use crypto currency technologies to kickstart a new economy of creative assets. 
We combine the traditional model of the limited edition with the unlimited access the Internet can offer. 
We introduce the crypto based model of *digital scarcity* as a new way to add financial value to the human values which the arts, music, or even open source software already freely transfer. 

We will do this by enhancing an existing crypto currency platform to issue a new currency, the Qllect (QLC). 
This new currency will be the unit of accounting for all creative assets issued as limited editions.

* In this paper we will discuss the non-technical implementation of the QLC and some of its use cases.
