## Abstract

Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are not just monetary instruments. 
Using them as cryptographic tokens for other assets is probably the most fascinating aspect. 
Examples for technical platforms going into this direction would be Colored Coins, Mastercoin, the freshly started Ethereum, Bitshares, Nxt, and others. 

We want to use crypto currency technologies to kickstart a new economy of creative assets. 
We combine the traditional model of the limited edition with the unlimited access the Internet can offer. 
We introduce the crypto based model of *digital scarcity* as a new way to add financial value to the human values which the arts, music, or even open source software already freely transfer. 

We will do this by enhancing an existing crypto currency platform to issue a new currency, the Qllect (QLC). 
This new currency will be the unit of accounting for all creative assets issued as limited editions.

* In this paper we will discuss the non-technical implementation of the QLC and some of its use cases.

## Background

Even if the final impact of the grand Bitcoin experiment is far from clear: 
the first results are in, and all looks pretty fascinating. 
Crypto currencies are more and more well accepted by many first movers, with Bitcoin alone now having reached a market capitalization of more than 10 Billion USD. 

Alternative currencies are popping up everywhere: 
Litecoin, which uses a slightly different mining mechanism, has already reached a capitalization of half a Billion USD. 
DogeCoin, a Litecoin clone name after a popular Internet meme, reached in a very short time more than 60 Million USD. 
In January 2014, Coinmarketcap (http://coinmarketcap.com/) lists 86 crypto currencies (and that’s just the viable tip of the iceberg), with a combined market cap of over 13 Billion USD.

Most of those crypto currencies share one common feature, besides being closely related to Bitcoin: 
they aren’t backed by any other asset than the mutual believe in the respective currency and the intrinsic value of its scarcity. 

### Artists: creating value “out of thin air” since

If we look back and around: who did always create value “out of thin air” - and everybody was happy with it? 
Walk into any museum or library, listen to music, read a poem (even if just tattooed on Lady Gaga’s arm). 
Artists, creative workers, always stand on the shoulders of giants, but then create “out of thin air”. 
As they start with a blank canvas, an empty score sheet, a blinking cursor. 
And when they’re done, they leave something which might make you sad or happy, stronger or more thoughtful. 
Their works make you dance or cry. 
The might even empower you by creating a piece of open source software (yes, coders can be creators as well). 
Creators create value. 

Unfortunately, the fungibility between the values they created and the financial values their landlord expects every month has always a been distorted. 
With the Internet, the spread has even become worse. 
Digital is great for creation and distribution. 
But it rarely pays back. 
In a file based world there is no limit. 
And as economic theory explains: an endlessly available resource makes a very bad asset. 

Thanks to Bitcoin and crypto currencies, we can change that equation. 
Because, as Richard Gendal Brown explains, the irreducible core of Bitcoin is Digital Scarcity. 
No copies. 
No double spending. 
No unmanageable central ledger to safeguard that.

* With the QLC, we introduce the model of digital scarcity into the creative world.

### A mutual creation of value

This does not mean we should try to go back into the dark times of DRM. 
As locking the access to a digital creation is not only futile, but mostly stupid as well. 
When the Saatchis invested in new British art, they didn’t hide their collection in a well climatized basement. 
The Saatchis, having made their money in advertising, built a gorgeous museum for their Hirsts and such. 
Because locked down art, which is neither seen nor watched or experienced, usually loses value. 

Collectors of digital creations do not even need to build a brick and mortar behemoth on a prime piece of real estate. 
YouTube and Vimeo and Soundcloud and Flickr and Facebook are already there. 
Everybody can watch. 
Everybody can listen to. 
Everybody can read. 
But only you (and a selected few) may own. 

That’s the secret of collecting. 
That’s what’s happening with numbered and signed limited editions since the invention of the printing press. 
It’s a pretty well established process to convert creative value into financial value. Which is good for the creator, but definitely a nice thing for the collector as well. 

* Signed and numbered copies of the work of a sought after artist not only look good, they can make a nice investment.

### More than a token benefit

If you collect, you’re part of a community, which appreciates and determines the value of the collected items. 
That’s what makes it really close to investing (it’s just not only about financial values), and at the same time that’s what makes the difference to hoarding. 
You hoard alone, just for yourself. 

The QLC not only enables digital scarcity. 
It creates a digital bond between creator and collector. 

* If creator and collector choose so, the crypto asset is not just about ownership, but a token to start a closer relationship.

### A sustainable model  

Qllect will be open source and modeled as a self-sustaining Decentralized Application, as described by David Johnston. 
As the example of Bitcoin shows, token based systems are so effective in becoming self sustaining because they empower the individual to have a stake in the outcome (Johnston). 
Decentralized Applications have an inherent business model, with all participants becoming a part of the value  creation process. 

Compare this to a centralized model like Twitter, where the value creation is mostly user-side, but the financial upside (if any) is locked up in a distant company.

## Introducing: Qllect

How could a crypto currency based system look like, which helps us to unlock the potential value of creative assets? 
At the core of Qllect lies the crypto representation of a creation. 
* If Katy releases a limited edition of her song, she issues a crypto asset, which has an authorized relation to the artist and the song.
* The hash of a relevant data set of the underlying creation is written in the Qllect-blockchain and is an integral part of the crypto asset.
* The crypto asset comes with ownership rights, is tradeable, and per default not divisible. 
* Just like a traditional merchandize article (e.g. a printed t-shirt), it doesn’t have to interfere with the intricacies of copyright law. (In a later stage, smart contracts could enhance the rights situation and make other use cases possible.)

The transfer mechanism works just as with Bitcoin or any other comparable crypto currency. 

If Katy’s fan Peter buys one of her digital collectibles, he goes to her website (or any other participating site). 
He pays with whichever currency seems conveniently accepted and receives ownership of the collectible asset.

### Why a new crypto currency?

So what is the the QLC and why is it necessary? 
Bitcoin and other crypto currencies offer already the trustless networks to safely transfer digital representations of property. 
It’s even possible to write the hash of the underlying creation into the blockchain. 
With the size of the underlying network, the Bitcoin blockchain would offer by far the securest approach to story crypto assets.

Unfortunately, there is no endorsed way to achieve this. 
To the contrary, asset representation mechanisms for the Bitcoin blockchain are still quite controversial in the Bitcoin community. 
Further developments regarding the Bitcoin core technologies might seriously impact any asset representation mechanism, which might look viable as of today.

* This risk drives the decision to create a new crypto currency, which should be as closely as possible aligned to the existing Bitcoin ecosystem. 

### The QLC as a crypto currency

Technically, the QLC will work on the same principles as Bitcoin or any other crypto currency. 
As a currency, it will be constructed quite differently: 

1. The primary use case of the QLC will be “internal unit of account”.
2. The QLC will be asset-backed, with the issued editions being the assets.

As creativity is infinite, there will be no hard limit on the number of possible QLCs. 
A precedent for that would be Peercoin. 
But as the QLC will be asset-backed, the number of actual QLCs will be correlated to the nominal QLC value of the newly issued editions at their primary sale, on top of a monetary base. 

This coupling mechanism will help to stabilize the QLC as a unit of account. 

At the same time, let’s not forget: we’re talking collectibles here. 
The liquidity of most assets will be rather low. 
With the QLC as the mutual accounting unit, an appreciation in value of the creative assets could be driven by network effects. 
For fine art investments, the long term return rates are (depending on how you count) slightly above or below stocks. 
If the basket of editions backing the QLC behaves comparably, the QLC should mirror this, like an asset based ETF based on a stock index mirrors the stock index.

In the beginning, there will be a timed window to create and distribute the monetary base, and allow for some initial price finding for the QLC. 
After settling the monetary base, assets will be created on top.

* The QLC will be an asset-backed crypto currency.

### The main components and processes

As a decentralized application, Qllect consists of two main parts, 

* the creations issued as tradable crypto assets, 
* and the currency backed by the crypto assets, as the host of the blockchain and internal unit of account.

#### The crypto asset

The crypto asset is the digital representation of a creative work of an identifiable issuer. 

##### Creation of a crypto asset

An identifiable issuer may create a limited edition of a creative work he has the rights to work with. 
The hash of certain meta data is written in the blockchain, to 
* make the underlying creation uniquely identifiable, 
* make the issuer of the asset uniquely identifiable,
* store some basic information about the underlying asset, like
** creator
** category of work
** ...
* store some core information on the crypto asset itself, like
** size of edition
** initial price

#### Transferring a crypto asset

The crypto asset is transferred from one QLC address to another.  
There will be a small network fee and a probably larger creator’s fee, going back to the issuer/creator of the underlying work. Both fees would be non-obligatory, but - as within Bitcoin - highly encouraged.

This chained payment has several effects: 
* For the creator, the appreciation of his work will pay out. 
** This minimizes the incentive to dilute the existing edition with new releases,
** thereby protecting the value for the original collector, 
** who might even have an additional incentive to hold on to his crypto asset.

### The crypto currency (QLC)

The QLC is the internal unit of account, the Qllect-blockchain holds all necessary data and information. 

#### Process example
A typical trading chain could look like this: 
1. Katy issues a limited edition of 100
2. Peter buys #1/100
  a. Katy gets paid
  b. Peter receives the asset
3. Peter sells #1/100 to Paul
  a. Peter gets paid
   - Katy gets percentage
  b. Paul receives the asset

## Restricted issuing
A typical Bitcoin-related regulation would by KYC/AML: Know Your Customer, Anti Money Laundering. 
Even if they would be applicable on a collectibles market: most asset transactions should be way under the thresholds of any KYC/AML regulation.
 
The real problem might be called Know Your Issuer (KYI), as the legitimacy of the issued edition is paramount for its further value.  
If Gustave wants to sell you the Eiffel Tower, he better has the right to do this. 
Basically, we hold it with Daniel Drew (1797-07-28 – 1879-09-18): 
*He who sells what isn't his'n, must buy it back or go to pris'n.* 
But if Gustave would be a fraudulently made up entity, this threat would be vain.

In the long run, the authorization process could become an increasingly automated process, e.g. by working with services like BlockScore and other partners, and enable virtually everybody to issue editions of their images, recordings, writings, of their creative works. 
* Qllect itself may be a trustless system. But the issuing part always involves trust into the issuing party. This is not a flaw. It is an inherent quality of the system.

## Exchange

Basically, it is a separate problem. 
But without fungibility, the QLC just stays an internal unit of account. 
Having lots of karma points might make you feel better, but never filled anybody’s fridge.

As a first step, crypto currency exchanges would have to be found, so buyer Peter can converts crypto currencies like BTC in QLC.

But the less friction, the better. So in a next step, buying and selling with currencies like EUR or USD will have to be enabled.

This might look like a very good use case for the Ripple network.

## Technical Background

We do not plan to reinvent the wheel. 
We will work with existing platforms and, if necessary, retool them for our needs. 

The implementation details will be discussed in a separate technical whitepaper.
